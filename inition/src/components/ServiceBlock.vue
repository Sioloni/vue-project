      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>
        I will work with my guides and yours energetically and telepathically to
        explore your soul path, purpose in life, things that are<br />blocking
        you and how to unblock them, and anything else relevant to your
        happiness, growth and well-being. I work with Leah, a 6th<br />dimensional
        Venusian; the Arcturians, 7th dimensional ETs; Lord Sananda, the higher
        self of Jesus; the angels, archangels and<br />ascended masters; and the
        Founders, a 12th dimensional essence from the Great Central Sun.
      </p>
      <h3>Researches</h3>
      <p>
        We will explore your past and parallel lifetimes and use special
        spiritual and psychological reframing techniques to alter your<br />timeline.
        This work is especially powerful for healing chronic illnesses and core
        life issues. Suggested Love Offerings: Same<br />schedule as Clairvoyant
        Readings with Conscious Channeling.
      </p>
      <h3>Offer on techniques</h3>
      <p>
        I might offer you a healing technique, clear your aura, balance your
        chakras, do energy work, or even laying on of hands (if you<br />meet me
        in person). I follow my inner guidance on this. At the very least, you
        will receive a blessing and prayer. I will hold you in the<br />light
        continuously and see you as the perfect manifestation of God that you
        are. If I see imbalances I may or may not bring them to<br />your
        attention before channeling a healing. Sometimes it is best to know
        everything that is going on within; other times it is not <br />
        imperative.
